            <b>Keqing</b> (Chinese: 刻晴 Kèqíng, "Sunny Moment" or "Delicate Carving") is a playable Electro character in Genshin Impact.
            As the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing, she is someone who seeks her own answers instead of idly letting chaos run amok in Liyue.
            She chooses her own path with her own power and ability, instead of letting the gods determine her fate.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p class="text">
            The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Keqing has much to say about Rex Lapis' unilateral approach to policymaking
            in Liyue ⁠— but in truth, gods admire skeptics such as her quite a lot.
            She firmly believes that humanity's future should be determined by humans themselves, and that they can even do
            better than the archons and adepti have done for them. In order to prove this, she works harder than anyone else.

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p class="text">
        <i>The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Keqing has much to say about Rex Lapis' unilateral approach to policymaking in Liyue —
            but in truth, gods admire skeptics such as her quite a lot.
            -In-game character attributes text</i><br><br>

        <em>One of the Liyue Qixing, Keqing has an uncompromising belief in actions over words.
            If she sees something that needs doing, she'll do it herself. For example, she traveled around Liyue and carefully memorized each detail of the
            land so that she may one day be able to maximize the utility of every last inch of Liyue.</em><br><br>

        <i>Keqing deals with the day-to-day affairs of Liyue, whether great or small, while Rex Lapis only descends once a year. To many, the
            millennia of prosperity that Liyue has enjoyed serve to legitimize Rex Lapis' guidance of the city. But Keqing has her reservations about all this,
            viewing Liyue's present prosperity as akin to a magnificent sandcastle on the beach — humanity does not have the luxury of deciding when the tide will come in.</i><br><br>

        <i>Rex Lapis has watched over Liyue for a millennium. But what about the next millennium? What about the next ten, or the next hundred millennia?
            How long are we expecting this status quo to last?</i><br><br>

        <i>It is this unanswered question that drives Keqing to work relentlessly and remain diligent. From most people's perspective, there is no point in
            working oneself up like this. But Keqing cannot sit by idly and ignore this hidden danger.</i><br><br>
